During my time as a fellow at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/), I've built a number of tools to help with data science tasks such as visualizing and exploring data held in Pandas dataframes, as well as visualizing the outputs of Machine Learning models. 

I've posted here my toolkit for doing these analyses:

I have also written an ipython notebook with usage examples of some of the functions. You can find it here:

Enjoy!
