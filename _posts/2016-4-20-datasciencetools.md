During my time as a fellow at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/), I've built a number of tools to help with data science tasks such as visualizing and exploring data held in Pandas dataframes, as well as visualizing the outputs of Machine Learning models. 

Here you can find my github repo for the data science toolkit:

Here you can find an ipython notebook with usage examples of some of the functions:

Thanks & enjoy!
