### The lead data challenge

Lead poising has become a highly visible environmental health disaster. In this project, you will help decision makers use data to inform what areas or households to test for lead poising. Due to limited resources most local health departments can only test a small number of people. The goal is to help them target their testing efforts to identify the most vulnerable people to lead poisoning.

To answer this question you need to collect lead poisoning data for a particular geography (city, state, nation, or globe). The quantity of interest is the blood lead level. You should conduct an exploratory data analysis of the data you collect keeping in mind that you want to use your analysis to make recommendations to others (thus the more granular the data the better). Provide at least one spatial or spatio-temporal visualization of your data.
