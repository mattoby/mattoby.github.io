Hi, I'm Matthew. I enjoy rockclimbing, getting outdoors, and eating delicious food. 

I also like navigating complicated data landscapes, and using analysis to get to the bottom of things.

Currently, I'm an Insight fellow for data science. I've done a project analyzing Parkinson's disease patient progress with a mobile app, which you can see here: <<<<insert hyperlink>>>
