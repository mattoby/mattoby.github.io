Hi, I'm Matthew. I enjoy rockclimbing, getting outdoors, and eating delicious food. 

I also like navigating complicated data landscapes, and using analysis to get to the bottom of things.

Currently, I'm an [Insight fellow for data science](http://insightdatascience.com/). I've done a project analyzing Parkinson's disease patient progress with a mobile app, which you can see [here](http://mattoby.github.io/mpowermemory/).
